# MPC_annotator.py

created by Stuart Cannon s.cannon@exeter.ac.uk

This code takes an Alamut annotated VCF file and adds the Exac MPC score generated by Samoch et al. 2017.

These need to be present on the local system and can be downloaded form here:

    wget ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release/release1/regional_missense_constraint/

It will only add an MPC score to the RefSeq equivalent of the canonical Ensemble transcript.
Where there are not exact equivalents exceptions may occur.
It takes about 0.1 seconds per variant and reads all variants into memory.

prerequisites: 
* developed on python 2.7
* sys, requests, subprocess
* tabix

## usage:

    python MPC_annotator.py [alamut_annotated_vcf] [mpc_file]

example usage:

    python exac_coverage_20x.py 1 /path/to/alamut_vcf /path/to/mpc_file
